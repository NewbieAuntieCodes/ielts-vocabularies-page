She has a busy job, and she needs to work every day. Even when she is tired, she never complains. She always tries her best to do her work well and support our family.<br/><br/>At the same time, she takes very good care of me. She cooks for me, reminds me to eat well, and makes sure I get enough rest. When I feel stressed or unhappy, she always listens to me and encourages me. Sometimes she is tired after work, but she still asks about my day and helps me.<br/><br/>What made me feel really proud was that she could balance both her job and her family. It is not easy to do well in work and still have time and energy for family, but she does both. She is strong and responsible.<br/><br/>I felt proud of her because she showed me what real love and responsibility mean. She works hard not only for herself, but also for our family. She is my role model, and I hope I can become someone like her in the future.",

The time I felt most proud of her was about four years ago.<br/><br/>Before that, her studies weren't very good, and she often disappointed my parents. She preferred having fun and didn't really take school seriously. She also didn't have a clear plan for her future. But one day, she suddenly realised that this was a serious problem and that she needed to change.<br/><br/>After that, she started to study really hard. Every day after she came home, she had dinner quickly and then went to her room to study. She spent a lot of time reviewing and preparing for exams. Step by step, her results improved a lot.<br/><br/>In the end, she was accepted into her dream university, which is also a very famous one. Now she has already graduated from that university.<br/><br/>My whole family is very proud of her, and I'm especially proud because she proved that people can change if they truly make up their minds. Her story really inspires me, and it makes me admire her a lot.",

You can find clothing stores, shoe shops, and electronics stores. There are also many restaurants and cafés, so it’s very convenient to eat there. One special thing about this mall is that it has an indoor museum-like area and some fun places for children, which makes it more interesting than other malls.<br/><br/>When I go to the mall, I usually buy clothes, snacks, or daily things. Sometimes I just walk around, look at the shops, and enjoy the air-conditioned environment. If I feel tired, I like to sit in a café and have a drink. I also often eat with my friends there, because there are many different kinds of food.<br/><br/>I like this shopping mall because it is convenient, comfortable, and fun.
