She always tries her best to do her work well and support our family.<br/><br/>At the same time, she takes very good care of me.

Sometimes she is tired after work, but she still asks about my day and helps me.<br/><br/>What made me feel really proud was that she could balance both her job and her family. It is not easy to do well in work and still have time and energy for family, but she does both. She is strong and responsible.<br/><br/>I felt proud of her because she showed me what real love and responsibility mean. She works hard not only for herself, but also for our family.

My mom worked during the day, and after work, she went to the hospital to look after her. Even though she was very tired, she never complained. She cooked for the family, helped my grandmother, and still tried her best to support me with my study.<br/><br/>What made me feel proud was not something big, but her attitude. She stayed calm, patient, and kind, even under a lot of pressure. She always put her family first.<br/><br/>Because of this experience, I really felt proud of my mom. She showed me what responsibility and love mean. I learned that being strong doesn’t mean being loud, but being willing to take care of others quietly. That’s why she is someone I truly admire.',

                  'I’d like to describe a child who really loves drawing. He is my cousin, and he is about eight years old.<br/><br/>I first got to know him when he was very young, because our families often spend time together. I see him quite often, especially on weekends or during holidays, so I know him very well.<br/><br/>He draws almost every day. When he finishes his homework, the first thing he wants to do is take out his paper and pencils. Sometimes he draws for half an hour, and sometimes he can draw for a very long time without getting bored. He likes drawing animals, cartoons, and things he sees in daily life, such as houses, trees, and people.<br/><br/>I think he loves drawing because it makes him feel happy and relaxed. When he is drawing, he becomes very quiet and focused. He doesn’t like to stop, even when adults ask him to take a break. Also, his parents always encourage him and praise his drawings, which makes him more confident.<br/><br/>In my opinion, drawing is a good habit for a child. It helps him express his ideas and improves his imagination. That’s why I believe he truly loves drawing and will keep doing it in the future.',

It is located in the center of Guangzhou, on Tianhe Road, and it is very easy to get there by subway.<br/><br/>I visit this mall quite often, usually once or twice a month. Sometimes I go there with my friends, and sometimes I go with my family. When I don’t know where to go on weekends, this mall is always a good choice.<br/><br/>Zhengjia Shopping Mall is very big and modern. It has many floors and a lot of shops inside. You can find clothing stores, shoe shops, and electronics stores. There are also many restaurants and cafés, so it’s very convenient to eat there. One special thing about this mall is that it has an indoor museum-like area and some fun places for children, which makes it more interesting than other malls.<br/><br/>When I go to the mall, I usually buy clothes, snacks, or daily things. Sometimes I just walk around, look at the shops, and enjoy the air-conditioned environment. If I feel tired, I like to sit in a café and have a drink. I also often eat with my friends there, because there are many different kinds of food.<br/><br/>I like this shopping mall because it is convenient, comfortable, and fun. It is not only a place to shop, but also a place to relax and spend time with others. That’s why Zhengjia Shopping Mall is my favorite shopping mall in Guangzhou.",

It’s located in Guangzhou, right by the Pearl River, and it’s one of the most iconic landmarks in the city.<br/><br/>What makes it stand out is its modern design. The tower is extremely tall, and the structure looks like it twists in the middle, which gives it a really unique silhouette. At night, it’s lit up with colourful LED lights, so it almost looks like a huge light show in the sky. From far away, you can still spot it easily, and it’s a popular place for people to take photos, especially during sunset.<br/><br/>In terms of function, it’s mainly a sightseeing and tourism attraction. Visitors can take an elevator to the observation decks to get a panoramic view of Guangzhou, including the river, bridges and the skyline. There are also restaurants and some entertainment facilities. For example, there’s a rotating restaurant, and there are some thrilling activities like the sky drop and an outdoor platform for people who enjoy a bit of adventure. On top of that, the tower also has a practical purpose, because it’s used for broadcasting and communication.<br/><br/>I find it interesting not only because it looks impressive, but also because it represents the city. To me, it’s more than a tall tower—it’s a symbol of Guangzhou’s modern development, and it always leaves a strong impression on me.',

It is in Guangzhou, near the Pearl River, and you can see it from many places in the city.<br/><br/>The Canton Tower is very tall and looks modern. It has a special shape, because it looks a little bit twisted in the middle. At night, it lights up in different colours, and it looks very beautiful. Many people like to take photos there, especially in the evening.<br/><br/>The main function of the tower is for tourism and sightseeing. People can buy tickets and take an elevator to the top. From there, you can see the river, the bridges and many tall buildings. There are also some restaurants and small shops inside. Some visitors also try exciting activities, like standing on an outdoor platform and enjoying the view from a high place. Besides that, the tower is also used for broadcasting and communication.<br/><br/>I think the Canton Tower is interesting because it is a famous symbol of Guangzhou. I visited it once with my friend, and we took many photos and enjoyed the night view. The city looked amazing from the top, and I felt very relaxed. That’s why I think it is a really interesting building.',

In the evening, the lights change all the time, and many people stop to watch them.<br/><br/>The tower has many functions. People can buy a ticket and go up to the top of the tower. From there, they can enjoy the view of the whole city. Inside the tower, there are also many restaurants with a variety of food, so people can have meals there while enjoying the view.<br/><br/>Around the Guangzhou Tower, the area feels very lively, especially at night or during festivals. Many people like to take a walk under the tower, enjoy the river view, and spend time with friends or family.<br/><br/>I think the Guangzhou Tower is very interesting because it is not only a landmark building, but also a place for tourism, entertainment, and relaxation.

The wedding was held in a big hotel ballroom, and there was live music during the dinner.<br/><br/>I went there with my cousin, because she also knew the bride. We decided to go mainly because it was an important day for my classmate, and I wanted to show my support. Also, I hadn’t seen many of our old friends for a long time, so I thought it would be a good chance to meet people and chat.<br/><br/>However, I didn’t enjoy the music played there at all. The first reason was the volume. It was extremely loud, especially near the stage, and my ears felt uncomfortable after a while. When my cousin and I tried to talk, we had to shout, and it was really tiring. The second reason is that the songs were not my type. They played lots of noisy pop songs and some old-fashioned wedding songs. To be honest, I prefer softer music, like acoustic songs or light English pop.<br/><br/>Also, the singer wasn’t very professional. Sometimes he sang off key, and the sound system had an echo, so it didn’t sound clear. So even though the wedding itself was meaningful, the music made the atmosphere stressful, and I couldn’t really relax and enjoy the event.",

I couldn’t really enjoy it because the sound was too strong, and it even made me feel a little uncomfortable.<br/><br/>After we left the festival, we searched online to find out what type of music it was. Then I learned that it was called heavy metal. I realized that this kind of music is really not for me.

We both enjoy outdoor activities, but recently we’ve been busy with our studies, so we haven’t had much time to relax. That’s why I think a cycling trip would be a perfect way for us to take a break and spend some quality time together.<br/><br/>The place I would like to go is a large park not far from the city. It has wide cycling paths, lots of trees, and a beautiful lake in the center. The environment is very peaceful, and the air is much fresher than in downtown areas. While riding our bikes, we could enjoy the natural scenery, listen to birds, and maybe even stop for a picnic.<br/><br/>I’d prefer to go in early autumn because the weather is cool and comfortable—not too hot and not too cold. It would make the whole trip much more enjoyable, especially since cycling can be tiring in extreme temperatures.<br/><br/>The main reason I want to go by bicycle is that it allows us to slow down and truly appreciate our surroundings. Unlike traveling by car, cycling gives us more freedom to stop whenever we want, take photos, or simply rest. It’s also a great form of exercise, so it benefits both our physical and mental health.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this bicycle trip would be relaxing, healthy, and memorable, and it would give us a great opportunity to strengthen our friendship.',

Besides that, it has many useful functions. The camera quality is excellent, so I can take very clear and beautiful photos. It also runs very smoothly when I play games, which greatly improves my overall experience.<br/><br/>I think I spent more than expected mainly because of the advertisements. The commercials made the phone look extremely impressive, highlighting its powerful features and fashionable design. After watching them, I was convinced that it was worth the price, even though it was slightly beyond my budget.<br/><br/>Looking back, although it was quite expensive, I still believe it was a good investment because I use my phone every day for communication, entertainment, and even study.

Before I had it, I often forgot to drink water, and then I got a dry throat and felt low energy. With my thermos, water is always there, so I drink more naturally. Second, it keeps water warm for a long time. In winter, warm water makes me feel comfortable, and it’s also better for my stomach. Third, it helps me save money and stay healthier, because I don’t need to buy sugary drinks or coffee every day. It’s also better for the environment, because I can use one bottle again and again.<br/><br/>I can’t live without it because it supports my health and my routine.

I can put some clothes and personal items in it, and it saves me a lot of trouble. Because it is quite big, I don’t need to worry about not having enough space.<br/><br/>The reason why I can’t live without this bag is that it makes my life more organized and convenient. Also, every time I use it, it reminds me of my brother, so it has special meaning to me.<br/><br/>Overall, this bag is not just a daily necessity, but also an important part of my life.",

                  'I would like to talk about something that I can’t live without, and that is my glasses.<br/><br/>Because I am short-sighted, I need to wear glasses every day. They are very important for me. Glasses help me with social communication. If I don’t wear them, sometimes I can’t see people clearly when they say hello to me, and I might lose some chances to make friends. When I wear glasses, I can see others’ faces clearly and feel their emotions better.<br/><br/>Another important reason is that glasses help me study. They help me see the questions clearly and solve them more quickly. Without glasses, everything looks blurry, and it becomes harder for me to focus.<br/><br/>Also, in some activities, glasses are very necessary. For example, I really like skiing, but this sport can be a little dangerous. When I wear glasses, I can see the road clearly and avoid getting hurt.<br/><br/>So for me, glasses are very important because they make my life more convenient. If I lose them, many things will become more difficult. That is why I truly feel that I can’t live without my glasses.',

                  "I’d like to talk about a movie I watched recently and really enjoyed. The movie is Avatar 3. I watched it about two weeks ago at a large cinema near my home. The cinema was very modern, and the screen was huge, so the visual effects looked very impressive.<br/><br/>I watched this movie with one of my close friends because we both like science fiction films. We bought some popcorn and drinks, and it felt like a relaxing weekend activity after a busy week of studying.<br/><br/>The movie is about the world of Pandora and the people who live there. In this new story, the main characters meet a new tribe, and they face different challenges. There are many exciting scenes, such as flying creatures, beautiful oceans, and some battles. The movie also shows the importance of protecting nature and working together with others.<br/><br/>I decided to watch this movie because I had already seen the previous Avatar films, and I was very curious about the new story. Also, many people were talking about it online, so I wanted to see if it was really that good.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie mainly because the pictures were amazing and very colorful. It felt like I was traveling to another world. The sound effects were also great, which made the movie more exciting. Even though the movie was quite long, I didn’t feel bored at all.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience, and I would definitely recommend it to my friends if they like action and science fiction movies.",

We wanted to spend some family time together, so we decided to watch this very popular movie.<br/><br/>The movie is about a new planet where many aliens live. Humans want to take over the planet because they need more space and resources. Because of this, there are many conflicts between humans and the aliens. The movie shows their different cultures and the way they try to protect their home.<br/><br/>However, to be honest, I didn’t enjoy the movie very much. The biggest problem was that it was too long, about three hours. After watching for a long time, I started to feel a little tired and even a bit bored.<br/><br/>The main reason I chose this movie is that it was very famous. I watched Avatar 1 and Avatar 2 a few years ago, and I liked them very much. Many people were talking about this new movie and said it was worth watching, so I wanted to see it by myself.<br/><br/>But after watching it, I felt a little disappointed because it was not as excellent as I expected. I even felt like I wasted time.<br/><br/>Overall, although it is a popular movie with great special effects, it is probably not my favorite, and I don’t think I would watch it again.",
