She has a busy job, and she needs to work every day. Even when she is tired, she never complains. She always tries her best to do her work well and support our family.<br/><br/>At the same time, she takes very good care of me. She cooks for me, reminds me to eat well, and makes sure I get enough rest. When I feel stressed or unhappy, she always listens to me and encourages me. Sometimes she is tired after work, but she still asks about my day and helps me.<br/><br/>What made me feel really proud was that she could balance both her job and her family. It is not easy to do well in work and still have time and energy for family, but she does both. She is strong and responsible.<br/><br/>I felt proud of her because she showed me what real love and responsibility mean. She works hard not only for herself, but also for our family. She is my role model, and I hope I can become someone like her in the future.",

The time I felt most proud of her was about four years ago.<br/><br/>Before that, her studies weren't very good, and she often disappointed my parents. She preferred having fun and didn't really take school seriously. She also didn't have a clear plan for her future. But one day, she suddenly realised that this was a serious problem and that she needed to change.<br/><br/>After that, she started to study really hard. Every day after she came home, she had dinner quickly and then went to her room to study. She spent a lot of time reviewing and preparing for exams. Step by step, her results improved a lot.<br/><br/>In the end, she was accepted into her dream university, which is also a very famous one. Now she has already graduated from that university.<br/><br/>My whole family is very proud of her, and I'm especially proud because she proved that people can change if they truly make up their minds. Her story really inspires me, and it makes me admire her a lot.",

You can find clothing stores, shoe shops, and electronics stores. There are also many restaurants and cafés, so it’s very convenient to eat there. One special thing about this mall is that it has an indoor museum-like area and some fun places for children, which makes it more interesting than other malls.<br/><br/>When I go to the mall, I usually buy clothes, snacks, or daily things. Sometimes I just walk around, look at the shops, and enjoy the air-conditioned environment. If I feel tired, I like to sit in a café and have a drink. I also often eat with my friends there, because there are many different kinds of food.<br/><br/>I like this shopping mall because it is convenient, comfortable, and fun.

                  'My favorite place in my house where I can relax is my bedroom. It is on the second floor of my home, and it is not very big, but it is very comfortable and quiet.<br/><br/>My bedroom is simple and clean. There is a bed, a desk, a chair, and a bookshelf. The walls are light-colored, so the room looks bright. There is also a window next to my bed, and I can see the sky and some trees outside. When the weather is good, I like to open the window and let fresh air come in.<br/><br/>In my bedroom, I enjoy doing many things. I often listen to music, watch videos, or play games on my phone. Sometimes I sit at my desk to do homework or read a book. When I feel tired after school, I like to lie on my bed and rest for a while.<br/><br/>I feel relaxed in this place because it is very quiet and private. No one disturbs me there, and I can do whatever I like. It is my own space, so I feel safe and comfortable. That is why my bedroom is my favorite place to relax in my house.',

                answer:
                  'An interesting building I would like to describe is the Canton Tower. It is located in Guangzhou, near the Pearl River, and it is one of the most famous landmarks in the city.<br/><br/>The Canton Tower looks very tall and modern. It has a very special shape, like a twisted tube. At night, it is covered with colorful lights, so it looks beautiful and eye-catching. From far away, it looks like a shining line in the sky. Many people like to take photos of it, especially in the evening.<br/><br/>The main function of the Canton Tower is for tourism and sightseeing. Visitors can go up to the top to enjoy the city view. There are observation decks, a rotating restaurant, and even some exciting activities like the sky drop and outdoor walking platform. It is also used for broadcasting and communication.<br/><br/>I think the Canton Tower is very interesting because of its unique design and its amazing night view. It is not just a tall building, but also a symbol of Guangzhou. Every time I see it, I feel proud of my city, and it always leaves a strong impression on me.',

The pictures were beautiful, and the story was interesting. Many people also said the new movie had great special effects, so I had high expectations.<br/><br/>However, I didn’t like it very much. First, I felt the story was too slow. Many scenes were very long, but not much happened. I was waiting for something exciting, but it didn’t come. Second, the story was a little confusing. There were too many characters, and I couldn’t remember who was who. It made it hard to follow the plot.<br/><br/>Another reason is that the story was not very new. It felt similar to the earlier movies. There was still a fight between humans and the Na’vi, and the ending was quite predictable. I hoped for a bigger surprise, but I didn’t get one.<br/><br/>I decided to watch it because I trusted the Avatar series and believed it would be amazing. I also wanted to enjoy the visuals on a big screen. The movie was beautiful, and the colors and scenes were great, but a movie is not only about pictures. The story is very important too.<br/><br/>So I felt disappointed because I expected a strong story and exciting moments, but I got a slow and ordinary one. It was not terrible, but it was not as good as I hoped.",

I watched it in the cinema when it was released, about two years ago.<br/><br/>I decided to watch it because I am a big fan of the Avengers series. I waited for this movie for about one year. I really loved the previous movies, and I had very high expectations. Also, my favourite hero is Iron Man, whose real name is Tony Stark. He is one of the most important leaders in the team, so I was very excited to see him again.<br/><br/>The movie itself was wonderful. The story was great, the plot was amazing, and the special effects were excellent. Everything looked very exciting and powerful.<br/><br/>However, I still felt disappointed because of the ending. Iron Man sacrificed himself and died. I never thought he would die, because he was such an important character and a leader in the team. He was also my favourite hero, so when I saw him die on the screen, I felt very sad and shocked.<br/><br/>So even though the movie was brilliant in many ways, I didn’t like the ending.
