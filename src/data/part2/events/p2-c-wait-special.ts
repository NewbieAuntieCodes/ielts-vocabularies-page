                answer: "I remember a time when I waited for a very special thing. I waited for my university acceptance result. I applied to my dream university after my final exams in high school. The university said they would post the results online on a specific day in July. It was a very important day for me.<br/><br/>I waited at home. I stayed in my room with my computer all day. I was too nervous to go outside or do anything else. I just sat in front of my desk and looked at the clock. My parents knew I was nervous, so they did not disturb me. They just brought me some food and water.<br/><br/>It was special because this result would decide my future. Going to that university was my biggest dream. I worked so hard for many years for this one moment. All my teachers and family members hoped I could get in. So, there was a lot of hope and pressure on me.<br/><br/>While I was waiting, I felt very, very nervous. My heart was beating so fast. I could not eat well or sleep the night before. I kept refreshing the university's website again and again, but nothing changed. My hands were cold and shaking. I imagined both good results and bad results. Finally, when the result came out, I saw the word 'Accepted'. I was so happy that I shouted. It was a feeling I will never forget. It was a mix of relief and great happiness."

                answer: "I’d like to talk about a time I waited for something very special, which was my surprise 18th birthday party. My friends had been acting a bit secretive for a few weeks, and one of them accidentally mentioned they were planning something big for me. I was supposed to pretend I didn't know anything.<br/><br/>On the day of my birthday, my parents told me we were going to a nice restaurant for a quiet family dinner. So I waited at home, getting ready and feeling the excitement build up. Then we went to the restaurant. I waited in the car for a moment while my dad went inside, and then we all walked into a private room.<br/><br/>This was an incredibly special moment for me. Turning 18 is a huge milestone in my country; it means you are officially an adult. I was also very touched that my friends would go to so much trouble to organize a party for me. It showed how much they cared about me.<br/><br/>My feelings during the wait were very intense. I was a mix of excited and curious. I kept trying to guess what kind of surprise it would be. In the restaurant, as I walked towards the room, my heart was pounding. When I opened the door and everyone shouted 'Surprise!', I was so happy. It was one of the best moments of my life, a mix of shock and pure joy. Seeing all my friends and family there just for me was an amazing feeling."

                answer: "I'm going to describe a time I was waiting for something truly special, which was the result of my university entrance application. I had applied to my dream university, and the results were scheduled to be released on a specific date. This was a hugely important moment that I had been working towards for a long time.<br/><br/>I remember that day vividly. I waited at home, mostly in my own room. I had my laptop set up on my desk, with the university's admissions portal open in a browser tab. I tried to act calm, but I was too restless to focus on anything else. I think I must have checked the website a hundred times that afternoon, hoping to see an update.<br/><br/>The reason this was so special was that it felt like a turning point in my life. Being accepted into that specific program was not just about getting a degree; it was about pursuing my passion and setting the foundation for my future career. I had poured countless hours into studying and preparing my application. Everything felt like it was leading up to this single moment.<br/><br/>While waiting, I experienced a real rollercoaster of emotions. I was incredibly anxious and my mind was racing. I kept imagining different scenarios – the joy of being accepted and the disappointment of being rejected. My hands were literally shaking as I refreshed the page for the final time. When I saw the acceptance letter on the screen, I was completely overwhelmed with happiness. It was a profound sense of relief and accomplishment, a feeling that all my hard work had finally paid off.",

                answer: "I'd like to share a memory of a time I waited for a very special event to happen. It was the day the admission results for my top-choice university were released. This was a pivotal moment for me, as I had spent the better part of my high school years working towards getting into their computer science program.<br/><br/>On the day the results were due, I confined myself to my room at home. I was glued to my chair, with my laptop open to the university's admissions portal. The hours seemed to drag on endlessly. I tried to distract myself with a movie, but I couldn't concentrate at all. My parents were great; they knew I needed some space and just quietly left snacks by my door.<br/><br/>This wait was so special because it represented the culmination of years of dedication. It wasn't just about getting into a good school; it was about validating all the sacrifices I had made and proving to myself that I could achieve my goals. My whole academic and future career path seemed to hang in the balance, which made the anticipation almost unbearable.<br/><br/>My feelings during that wait were a chaotic mix of anxiety and excitement. I felt like I was on pins and needles the entire day. Every notification sound from my phone made my heart jump. As the designated time approached, my palms were sweating. When I finally refreshed the page and saw the word 'Accepted', a wave of pure elation washed over me. I let out a huge shout of joy. It was an incredible feeling, a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders, and I felt like I was on top of the world.",

      question: 'Who behave better when waiting, children or adults?',
      versions: [{ score: '5.5', answer: "Generally, I think adults behave better when waiting. They have more self-control and understand that waiting is often necessary. Children, on the other hand, can get bored and restless very easily, so they might start to complain or cry." }]

    {
      question: 'Compared to the past, are people less patient now? Why?',
      versions: [{ score: '5.5', answer: "Yes, I believe people are generally less patient now. This is probably because of modern technology. We are used to getting information, entertainment, and even food almost instantly with our smartphones. This makes us expect quick results for everything, so waiting feels more difficult." }]

      question: 'What are the positive and negative effects of waiting on society?',
      versions: [{ score: '5.5', answer: "A positive effect is that waiting can teach patience and create order. For example, queuing ensures fairness. A negative effect is that it can cause stress and frustration. Also, long waits can be a waste of valuable time, which might reduce productivity for businesses and individuals." }]
    },
    {
      question: 'Why are some people unwilling to wait?',
      versions: [{ score: '5.5', answer: "I think there are a few reasons. Some people have very busy lives and feel that any time spent waiting is wasted time. For others, it might just be their personality; they are naturally impatient. And as I mentioned, our fast-paced society makes it harder for everyone to wait calmly." }]

      question: 'Where do children learn to be patient, at home or at school?',
      versions: [{ score: '5.5', answer: "I think children learn to be patient in both environments. At home, parents can teach them by making them wait for their turn or for a special treat. At school, they have to learn to wait to ask a question or to share classroom materials with others. Both home and school play important roles." }]
