          answer: "Last winter I took a slow overnight train from my hometown to Shanghai. It took about twelve hours, so it felt long. I sat by the window and watched the lights in small towns. I listened to music a bit and tried to sleep.<br/><br/>I went with my best friend. We shared bread and instant noodles on the train. When it stopped, we walked on the platform for a few minutes to stretch our legs.<br/><br/>I made this trip because I wanted to see the Bund and visit my aunt who works in Shanghai. The train ticket was cheap, and I had time, so a slow trip was fine for me.<br/><br/>I want to do this journey again. Next time I will stay near the river, eat soup dumplings, and take photos at night. The long ride was quiet and helped me relax."

          answer: "Last winter I took an overnight train from my hometown to Shanghai. It was about twelve hours, so it felt like a long trip. I sat by the window and watched small towns and lights at night. Sometimes I listened to music, sometimes I just rested.<br/><br/>I went with a close friend because both of us wanted to see Shanghai for the first time. We shared simple snacks and whispered about what to do there. When the train stopped, we got off for a few minutes to stretch our legs.<br/><br/>The main reason for the trip was to see the Bund and to visit my aunt who works in Shanghai. Taking the train was cheaper than flying, and we wanted a slow, easy journey.<br/><br/>I want to do this journey again because Shanghai felt big but also friendly. Next time, I hope to stay longer, walk by the river at night, and eat soup dumplings again. The long train ride gave me quiet time to relax and think."

          answer: "Last summer I took a long train ride from Beijing to Xining. It was almost two days on the train. I sat by the window and watched the fields, mountains, and desert.<br/><br/>I went with my cousin because we both had a long holiday. We shared snacks, played cards, and talked a lot. The train was slow but comfortable.<br/><br/>I took this journey because I wanted to see a different part of China and have some quiet time. I did not want a busy trip with flights.<br/><br/>I want to do it again because it was relaxing. Next time I hope to stop in small towns and maybe take my parents so they can enjoy the slow travel."

          answer: "One long journey I'd love to repeat was a two-day train ride from Beijing to Xining. The route offered a gradual reveal of China's landscapes—first endless plains, then rising hills, and finally stark desert views as we approached the plateau.<br/><br/>I travelled with my cousin during a university break. We treated the ride as a mini-retreat: we read novels, swapped music playlists, and even chatted with a retired couple who shared stories about travelling in the 1980s. The atmosphere on the train was unhurried, which made the time pass pleasantly.<br/><br/>The original motivation was to slow down and see a different side of the country without the stress of airports. I also wanted to clear my head after a busy semester and let the changing scenery do the talking.<br/><br/>I'd repeat this journey because it was surprisingly restorative. If I go again, I'd break up the trip with stops in smaller cities, try regional food along the way, and maybe bring my parents so they can experience how calming a long, slow journey can be."
