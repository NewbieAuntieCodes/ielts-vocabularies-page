            "I want to talk about an exciting activity I tried. The activity was indoor rock climbing. I had never done it before, so it was a new experience for me. I think it is a very cool sport.",
            "I did it last summer, in August. My friend asked me to go with him. We went to a big indoor climbing gym in the city center. The gym was very high and had many colorful walls. It looked very interesting and a little difficult.",
            "I thought it was exciting because it was a challenge for me. When I looked up at the wall, it was very tall, and I was a little scared of the height. It was also exciting because it was like solving a puzzle. You have to find the right places to put your hands and feet to go up.",
            "At first, I felt very nervous. My hands were sweating. But my friend taught me how to use the safety rope, so I knew I was safe. When I started climbing, I focused on the wall. I climbed slowly. The most difficult part was near the top. I was very tired, but I did not give up. When I finally reached the top and rang the bell, I felt so happy and proud of myself. It was a great feeling. I was not nervous anymore. I felt very strong and confident. I think I will try rock climbing again."

            "I'd like to talk about the first time I tried indoor rock climbing, which was a very exciting activity for me. I had seen it in movies, and it always looked really cool, so I was happy to finally try it myself.",
            "This happened last summer vacation, around July. My best friend, who is more adventurous than I am, invited me to go with him. We went to a large, modern climbing gym downtown. The place was amazing, with towering walls covered in colorful climbing holds. It was busy with many people climbing, which made the atmosphere very energetic.",
            "The main reason I found it exciting was the combination of physical challenge and a bit of fear. Looking up at the 20-meter-high wall was quite intimidating. It was exciting because it pushed me out of my comfort zone. Also, it's not just about strength; you have to think and plan your route to the top, which makes it mentally engaging as well.",
            "My feelings about it were a mix of nervousness and excitement. Before I started, I was quite scared, and my heart was beating fast. However, the staff gave us a good safety briefing, which helped me relax. The climb itself was tough, and my muscles started to ache halfway up. But the encouragement from my friend kept me going. When I finally touched the top, an incredible sense of accomplishment washed over me. I felt exhausted but incredibly proud. That feeling of overcoming a challenge made the whole experience unforgettable and very positive."

            "I'm going to describe a really exciting activity I tried for the first time, which was indoor rock climbing. It’s a sport that tests both your physical strength and your problem-solving skills, and I had been curious about it for a while.",
            "I tried it a few months ago, during the spring holiday. A friend of mine is a regular climber, and he suggested I join him at his local climbing gym. The place was impressive; it was a huge warehouse-like building with climbing walls of various difficulties, from simple vertical ones for beginners to complex, overhanging routes for experts. The atmosphere was very welcoming and supportive.",
            "For me, the excitement came from the sense of adventure and the challenge. Staring up at the tall wall from the ground felt quite daunting, and there was definitely a rush of adrenaline. It was exciting because it was a direct confrontation with my slight fear of heights. Moreover, each climbing route is like a vertical puzzle. You need to figure out the best sequence of moves, which makes it a very engaging mental exercise, not just a physical one.",
            "Initially, I felt a strong sense of apprehension. As the instructor was securing my harness, my palms were sweating. However, once I started climbing, I became completely focused on the task at hand. The physical exertion was intense, and there were moments I thought I couldn't go on. But pushing through that feeling and finally reaching the top was incredibly rewarding. It gave me a huge boost of confidence and a profound sense of achievement. I left the gym feeling tired but exhilarated, and I’ve been hooked on climbing ever since."

            "An exciting activity that I tried for the first time and would love to talk about is indoor rock climbing. It's a sport that combines athleticism with strategy, and my first experience with it was truly memorable.",
            "This was last autumn, when a friend convinced me to come along to a new bouldering gym that had just opened in our city. The facility was state-of-the-art, with creatively designed walls that mimicked real rock formations. The vibe was very cool and relaxed, with music playing and a community of climbers encouraging each other.",
            "What made it so exciting was the unique blend of mental and physical challenges. It was thrilling to be suspended several meters above the ground, relying solely on my own strength and technique. The adrenaline rush was undeniable. Furthermore, the activity was intellectually stimulating. You have to analyze the route, plan your moves, and solve the 'problem' of the climb. This strategic element made it far more captivating than simply lifting weights at a regular gym.",
            "My feelings about the experience evolved throughout the session. At first, I was filled with a mix of curiosity and intimidation. I felt clumsy and weak on my initial attempts. However, with some guidance from my friend, I began to understand the technique. The moment I successfully completed my first route, even though it was a very easy one, I felt an incredible surge of accomplishment. It was a powerful feeling of conquering both a physical obstacle and my own self-doubt. By the end of the day, I was physically exhausted but mentally energized and completely hooked. It was an exhilarating experience that I would highly recommend."

    question: 'Why are some people unwilling to try new things?',
    versions: [
      {
        score: '5.0',
        answer: "I think it is because they are scared. (Point) New things can be difficult. They don't want to fail. (Reason) For example, a person might not try a new sport because they think they will be bad at it and other people will laugh. (Example)"
      },
      {
        score: '5.5',
        answer: "I believe the main reason is a fear of the unknown. (Point) People often feel comfortable with their routines, and trying something new means facing uncertainty and the possibility of failure. (Reason) For instance, someone might hesitate to travel to a foreign country alone because they are worried about getting lost or not understanding the language. (Example)"
      },
      {
        score: '6.0',
        answer: "I would say that a primary reason is the comfort of familiarity. (Point) Most people have a natural tendency to stick to what they know because it's predictable and feels safe, whereas new experiences come with inherent risks and uncertainties. (Reason) To give an example, an office worker might stick with a job they don't love simply because the thought of learning a new role and meeting new colleagues is more intimidating than their current dissatisfaction. (Example)"
      },
      {
        score: '6.5',
        answer: "In my opinion, the reluctance to try new things often stems from a psychological attachment to one's comfort zone. (Point) This is because our routines provide a sense of security and predictability, while venturing into the unknown can trigger feelings of anxiety and the fear of potential failure or embarrassment. (Reason) For example, a person who has always eaten the same type of cuisine might refuse to try an exotic dish, not because they are sure they won't like it, but because they are uncomfortable with the uncertainty and prefer the guaranteed satisfaction of a familiar meal. (Example)"

    question: 'Do you think fear stops people from trying new things?',
    versions: [
      {
        score: '5.0',
        answer: "Yes, I think so. Fear is a big reason. (Point) People are afraid of getting hurt or making a mistake. (Reason) For example, someone might not learn to ride a bike because they are afraid of falling down. (Example)"
      },
      {
        score: '5.5',
        answer: "Yes, definitely. Fear is a powerful emotion that often prevents people from exploring new possibilities. (Point) This could be the fear of physical harm, failure, or even just social embarrassment. (Reason) For instance, many people dream of starting their own business but are stopped by the fear of losing their money and failing publicly. (Example)"
      },
      {
        score: '6.0',
        answer: "Absolutely, fear is arguably the single biggest obstacle. (Point) It acts as a mental barrier, preventing individuals from taking risks, whether those risks are physical, financial, or social. (Reason) To illustrate, a talented artist might never show their work to anyone because they are paralyzed by the fear of criticism and rejection, thus stopping them from pursuing a career in art. (Example)"
      },
      {
        score: '6.5',
        answer: "Without a doubt, fear is a primary inhibitor that stops people from embracing new experiences. (Point) The reason is that fear, particularly the fear of failure or negative judgment, can be so paralyzing that it outweighs the potential positive outcomes of trying something new. (Reason) A perfect example is public speaking. Countless individuals with valuable ideas remain silent in meetings or avoid career opportunities simply because their fear of stumbling over words or being judged by the audience is too overwhelming to overcome.

      {
        score: '5.0',
        answer: "I think they like the exciting feeling. (Point) Doing something dangerous is not boring. It makes their heart beat fast. (Reason) For example, people who do bungee jumping like the feeling of falling. It is very exciting for them. (Example)"
      },
      {
        score: '5.5',
        answer: "I believe it's for the adrenaline rush and the sense of accomplishment. (Point) These activities push their limits and make them feel alive in a way that normal life doesn't. (Reason) For instance, when someone finishes a marathon or climbs a mountain, they feel a huge sense of pride for having overcome a very difficult challenge. (Example)"
      },
      {
        score: '6.0',
        answer: "There are several reasons, but a major one is the pursuit of an adrenaline rush. (Point) Engaging in high-risk activities triggers a 'fight or flight' response, releasing adrenaline that creates a feeling of euphoria and heightened senses. (Reason) For example, a snowboarder going down a steep, ungroomed slope is seeking that intense feeling of speed and focus, which can be very addictive. (Example)"
      },
      {
        score: '6.5',
        answer: "From a psychological perspective, people are drawn to dangerous activities primarily for the intense emotional and physical sensations they provide, often called 'the thrill'. (Point) The reason is that successfully navigating a high-stakes situation provides a profound sense of mastery and achievement, which can significantly boost one's self-esteem. (Reason) Take skydiving, for instance. The act of jumping out of a plane is terrifying, but safely landing gives the person an unparalleled feeling of conquering their fear, making them feel powerful and alive. (Example)"

    question: 'Do you think that children adapt to new things more easily than adults?',
    versions: [
      {
        score: '5.0',
        answer: "Yes, I think so. Children learn fast. (Point) Their brains are still growing. They are not afraid to make mistakes. (Reason) For example, it is much easier for a child to learn a new language than for an adult. They can speak it very well. (Example)"
      },
      {
        score: '5.5',
        answer: "Yes, I generally believe that's true. Children seem to be more flexible and open-minded. (Point) This is because they have fewer established habits and preconceptions, so they approach new things with curiosity rather than skepticism. (Reason) For example, when a family moves to a new country, children often pick up the local language and customs much faster than their parents. (Example)"
      },
      {
        score: '6.0',
        answer: "Yes, I would agree that children generally have a greater capacity for adaptation. (Point) The main reason is their neuroplasticity; their brains are literally wired to learn and form new connections more efficiently than adult brains. Also, they have less fear of judgment. (Reason) A good example is learning to use new technology. A child can pick up how to use a tablet or a new app intuitively, through trial and error, while an adult might need instructions and feel more hesitant. (Example)"
      },
      {
        score: '6.5',
        answer: "Absolutely, it's widely observed that children adapt to new situations and skills with remarkable ease compared to adults. (Point) This is largely due to a combination of biological and psychological factors; their brains are more malleable, and they lack the ingrained habits and fear of failure that often hinder adults. (Reason) For instance, consider learning to ski. A child will often just go for it, falling and getting back up without much thought, whereas an adult is more likely to overthink the process and be inhibited by the fear of getting injured, which slows down their learning curve significantly. (Example)"

    question: 'What can people learn from doing dangerous activities?',
    versions: [
      {
        score: '5.0',
        answer: "They can learn to be brave. (Point) They have to face their fear. This makes them stronger. (Reason) For example, after someone tries rock climbing, they might feel less scared of other challenges in life. (Example)"
      },
      {
        score: '5.5',
        answer: "I think people can learn a lot about themselves, like how to stay calm under pressure. (Point) These activities force you to focus completely and manage your fear, which are useful skills. (Reason) For example, a scuba diver needs to control their breathing and not panic when they are deep underwater, and this skill can help them handle stress in their job. (Example)"
      },
      {
        score: '6.0',
        answer: "People can learn invaluable lessons about risk management and self-reliance. (Point) This is because these activities require meticulous preparation and the ability to make critical decisions under pressure, which builds confidence and problem-solving skills. (Reason) For example, a solo hiker planning a trip through a dangerous trail must learn to read maps, predict weather, and carry the right gear. These planning and survival skills are transferable to many aspects of life. (Example)"
      },
      {
        score: '6.5',
        answer: "Beyond the obvious thrill, people can learn profound lessons about their own limits and capabilities. (Point) The reason is that these activities push you to your physical and mental edge, forcing a deep level of self-awareness and resilience that everyday life rarely demands. (Reason) To illustrate, someone who trains for and completes an ultramarathon through a desert learns about discipline, endurance, and the power of their own mind to overcome extreme physical discomfort. This experience can fundamentally change their perspective on what they are capable of achieving in all other areas of their life. (Example)"

        score: '5.0',
        answer: "It makes life more interesting. (Point) If you always do the same thing, life is boring. New things are exciting. (Reason) For example, trying a new food or visiting a new place can be a very fun experience and give you a good memory. (Example)"
      },
      {
        score: '5.5',
        answer: "The main benefit is personal growth. (Point) Trying new things pushes you out of your comfort zone and helps you discover new skills and interests you didn't know you had. (Reason) For instance, someone might try a pottery class just for fun and discover they have a real talent for art, which could become a lifelong hobby. (Example)"
      },
      {
        score: '6.0',
        answer: "A significant benefit is that it builds confidence and resilience. (Point) The act of facing an unknown challenge and successfully navigating it, even on a small scale, reinforces your belief in your own abilities to handle uncertainty. (Reason) For example, traveling alone for the first time might be scary, but successfully planning the trip and solving problems along the way makes a person feel much more independent and capable. (Example)"
      },
      {
        score: '6.5',
        answer: "Perhaps the most profound benefit of trying new things is that it enhances cognitive flexibility and creativity. (Point) This is because new experiences create new neural pathways in the brain, which improves your ability to think in novel ways and adapt to changing circumstances. (Reason) For example, learning a musical instrument doesn't just teach you music; it improves your memory, coordination, and problem-solving skills, which can then be applied to your work or studies in unexpected ways. It keeps your mind sharp and open. (Example)"
