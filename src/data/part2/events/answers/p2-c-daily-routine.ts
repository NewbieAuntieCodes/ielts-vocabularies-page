            "I think it is a positive change because my morning is not busy. Reading a book is good for my brain. I feel calm and I can learn something new. It is much better than looking at my phone.",

            "I'd like to talk about a recent positive change in my daily routine, which is waking up earlier. I used to get up at 7:30 AM, but for the last month, I've been setting my alarm for 7:00 AM.",
            "I changed my routine by using this extra half-hour to read. Instead of grabbing my phone to check messages like I used to, I now make a cup of tea and read a chapter of a book. This has become my quiet time before the day gets busy.",
            "I believe this is a positive change because it makes my morning much more peaceful. I'm not rushing anymore, and I start the day feeling calm and focused. Reading also helps to wake up my mind, so I feel more prepared for my studies.",
            "I feel really happy about making this change. It was a bit difficult for the first week, but now I really enjoy this quiet time in the morning. It has had a good effect on my whole day, making me feel more productive and less stressed."

            "I'm going to talk about a positive adjustment I've recently made to my daily schedule, which is waking up 30 minutes earlier every day. I was someone who always hit the snooze button, but now I make sure to get out of bed at 7 AM sharp.",
            "So, how I've changed my routine is quite simple. Instead of my old habit of immediately checking social media on my phone, I now dedicate that extra half-hour to reading. I'll sit by the window with a book and just enjoy the quiet start to the day.",
            "I think this is a very positive change for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it allows me to begin my day in a much more mindful and calm manner, rather than being hit with the stress of news and notifications. Secondly, I feel it has boosted my productivity. By the time I start studying, my mind is already active and focused.",
            "Overall, I feel fantastic about this new routine. Although it was a bit of a struggle at the beginning, it has now become a habit that I genuinely look forward to. It has definitely improved my mood and my ability to concentrate throughout the day."

            "One of the most beneficial changes I've recently incorporated into my daily routine is the habit of waking up half an hour earlier. Previously, my morning would start at 7:30 AM, often in a frantic rush. Now, I consistently wake up at 7:00 AM.",
            "I've consciously altered my routine by replacing my old habit of scrolling through my phone first thing in the morning with reading. This extra 30 minutes has become my protected time for personal development, away from any digital distractions.",
            "This is an incredibly positive change because it has transformed my mornings from a chaotic scramble into a peaceful and intentional start to the day. It helps me gather my thoughts and sets a productive tone for the hours ahead. Furthermore, it has reignited my passion for reading, which I had been neglecting.",
            "Honestly, I feel wonderful about this adjustment. Initially, it required a fair bit of self-discipline to resist the snooze button, but the benefits have been so significant that it now feels completely natural. I'm calmer, more focused, and I feel like I'm investing in myself every single day, which is a great feeling."

      },
      {
        score: '6.0',
        answer: "In my opinion, young people tend to make changes more frequently. (Point) This is because they are at a stage in life where they are still exploring their identity and career paths.

        score: '6.5',

(Reason) For instance, a person in their twenties is more likely to spontaneously decide to change careers or move abroad, whereas an older person would find such changes much more disruptive.

      },
      {
        score: '6.5',
        answer: "Ideally, promotions should be entirely merit-based, independent of an employee's age. (Point) This is because both generations bring unique strengths; younger staff might excel in innovation, while senior employees provide deep industry knowledge. (Reason) A fair promotion system should evaluate candidates on their actual performance and leadership potential. For example, promoting the person who led a successful project, whether they are 25 or 55, benefits the entire organization. (Example)"
