                        answer: "I want to talk about a natural place I visited. It is Yellow Mountain. This is a very famous mountain in China. It is in Anhui province. It is not close to my city. I took a train to go there with my family. It was a long trip but very fun.<br/><br/>I knew this place from my school. My geography teacher showed us some pictures of it. The pictures were very beautiful. My teacher said it is one of the most beautiful mountains in our country. I always wanted to go there. So, last summer, I finally went. I was very happy about this trip.<br/><br/>The mountain is very big and high. There are many green trees and plants. The air on the mountain is very fresh and clean. It feels very good to breathe it. The rocks on Yellow Mountain are very special. They have strange shapes. Some look like animals, and some look like people. There are also many old pine trees. They grow on the rocks and look very strong. When you stand on the top, you can see clouds below you, like a sea of clouds. The view is amazing.<br/><br/>I like to visit this place because it is very different from my city. My city is noisy and has many people. But the mountain is quiet and peaceful. When I was there, I felt very relaxed. I could forget my stress from school. I also enjoyed walking on the mountain with my family. It was good exercise. Being in nature made me feel very happy. That is why I like Yellow Mountain very much. I want to visit it again one day."

                        answer: "I'm going to talk about a wonderful natural place I visited, which is Yellow Mountain, or Huangshan in Chinese. It's a very famous mountain in Anhui province. Many people, including tourists from other countries, go there every year because it is so beautiful.<br/><br/>I first learned about Yellow Mountain in my high school geography class. My teacher showed us many beautiful photos of the mountain. The pictures of the tall rocks and the sea of clouds were very impressive. From that moment, I told myself that I had to see it with my own eyes. So, I was very excited when my parents and I planned a trip there last summer vacation.<br/><br/>The mountain is really amazing. It has many tall peaks. The whole area is covered with green trees. The old pine trees are very special because they grow in strange places, like right on the rocks. The air there is very fresh and clean, which is a big change from the city. The most unforgettable thing for me was the view from the top. Looking down, you can see a thick layer of clouds that looks like an ocean. It's a view I will never forget.<br/><br/>The main reason I love this place is the feeling of peace it gives me. City life is always busy and sometimes stressful. But on the mountain, everything is quiet and calm. Walking on the trails and being surrounded by beautiful nature is a great way to relax and clear my mind. It's a perfect place to get away from my daily routine. It helps me feel refreshed and full of energy again. I really enjoyed my time there."

                        answer: "Today, I'd like to tell you about a beautiful natural place I visited, which is Huangshan, also known as Yellow Mountain. It’s a well-known mountain range in Anhui province and is famous all over China for its incredible scenery.<br/><br/>I first came to know about this place by watching a documentary a few years ago. I was really attracted by the beautiful shots of its unique landscape, especially the sharp peaks and the famous pine trees. It looked so amazing that I decided I must visit. I finally made the trip last year with a few of my friends, and it was even better than I had expected.<br/><br/>Being on the mountain is a wonderful experience. It's famous for its oddly-shaped rocks, old pine trees, and the 'sea of clouds'. The air feels so clean and fresh. We hiked along the paths and everywhere we looked, the view was beautiful, just like in a traditional Chinese painting. One of the best moments was getting up early to watch the sunrise. Seeing the sun come up over the clouds and light up the sky was a truly magical moment that I will always remember.<br/><br/>For me, the best part about visiting Huangshan is that it's a total escape from the busy city life. It is a place where you can really connect with nature and enjoy the quietness. The peaceful environment helps me to clear my head and just relax. It’s not just a physical trip, but also a good break for the mind. This feeling of being refreshed is why I found the trip so enjoyable and why I would love to go back.",

                        answer: "I'd like to share my experience of visiting a truly memorable natural place, which is Huangshan, or Yellow Mountain. It is a famous natural wonder in China, located in Anhui province, and is celebrated for its scenery that looks like it came straight out of a traditional painting.<br/><br/>My first encounter with this mountain was through some classic Chinese landscape paintings I saw online. I was fascinated by the beauty and the calm feeling in those artworks, and it made me really want to experience the place in person. I was lucky enough to go there with my family last summer, and it was even more amazing than I had imagined.<br/><br/>The mountain offers some of the most breathtaking views I’ve ever seen. It’s known for its granite peaks that rise high above a layer of clouds, which creates a magical, almost dream-like atmosphere. The old, tough pine trees that grow directly out of the rock are also incredible to see. The air is so pure and the environment is incredibly quiet, which is a sharp contrast to the city. The highlight for me was watching the sunrise. Seeing the sky fill with color while standing above a sea of clouds was an unforgettable experience that made me feel very small and amazed by nature.<br/><br/>The main reason this place is so special to me is the deep sense of peace it offers. It’s the perfect escape from my busy city life. Walking along the trails is more than just exercise; it feels like a form of meditation that helps me forget my worries and just enjoy the moment. It is a place that really allows you to recharge your batteries and gain a fresh perspective on life. That’s why I enjoyed it so much and would recommend it to anyone.",
