  { id: 1, text: "Welcome to the Fiddy Working Heritage Farm." },
  { id: 2, text: "This open-air museum gives you the experience of agriculture and rural life in the English countryside at the end of the nineteenth century." },
  { id: 3, text: "So you'll see a typical farm of that period, and like me, all the staff are dressed in clothes of that time." },
  { id: 4, text: "I must give you some advice and safety tips before we go any further." },
  { id: 5, text: "As it's a working farm, please don't frighten or injure the animals." },
  { id: 6, text: "We have a lot here, and many of them are breeds that are now quite rare." },
  { id: 7, text: "And do stay at a safe distance from the tools: some of them have sharp points which can be pretty dangerous, so please don't touch them." },
  { id: 8, text: "We don't want any accidents, do we?" },
  { id: 9, text: "The ground is very uneven, and you might slip if you're wearing sandals so I'm glad to see you're all wearing shoes - we always advise people to do that." },
  { id: 10, text: "Now, children of all ages are very welcome here, and usually even very young children love the ducks and lambs, so do bring them along next time you come." },
  { id: 11, text: "I don't think any of you have brought dogs with you, but in case you have." },
  { id: 12, text: "I'm afraid they'll have to stay in the car park, unless they're guide dogs." },
  { id: 13, text: "I'm sure you'll understand that they could cause a lot of problems on a farm." },
  { id: 14, text: "Now let me give you some idea of the layout of the farm." },
  { id: 15, text: "The building where you bought your tickets is the New Barn, immediately to your right, and we're now at the beginning of the main path to the farmland - and of course the car park is on your left." },
  { id: 16, text: "The scarecrow you can see in the car park in the corner, beside the main path, is a traditional figure for keeping the birds away from crops, but our scarecrow is a permanent sculpture." },
  { id: 17, text: "lt's taller than a human being, so you can see it from quite a distance." },
  { id: 18, text: "If you look ahead of you, you'll see a maze." },
  { id: 19, text: "It's opposite the New Barn, beside the side path that branches off to the right just over there." },
  { id: 20, text: "The maze is made out of hedges which are too tall for young children to see over them, but it's quite small, so you can't get lost in it!" },
  { id: 21, text: "Now, can you see the bridge crossing the fish pool further up the main path?" },
  { id: 22, text: "If you want to go to the café, go towards the bridge and turn right just before it." },
  { id: 23, text: "Walk along the side path and the café's on the first bend you come to." },
  { id: 24, text: "The building was originally the schoolhouse, and it's well over a hundred years old." },
  { id: 25, text: "As you may know, we run skills workshops here, where you can learn traditional crafts like woodwork and basket-making." },
  { id: 26, text: "You can see examples of the work, and talk to someone about the courses, in the Black Barn." },
  { id: 27, text: "If you take the side path to the right, here, just by the New Barn, you'll come to the Black Barn just where the path first bends." },
  { id: 28, text: "Now I mustn't forget to tell you about picnicking, as I can see some of you have brought your lunch with you." },
  { id: 29, text: "You can picnic in the field, though do clear up behind you, of course." },
  { id: 30, text: "Or if you'd prefer a covered picnic area, there's one near the farmyard: just after you cross the bridge, there's a covered picnic spot on the right." },
  { id: 31, text: "And the last thing to mention is Fiddy House itself." },
  { id: 32, text: "From here you can cross the bridge then walk along the footpath through the field to the left of the farmyard." },
  { id: 33, text: "That goes to the house, and it'll give you a lovely view of it." },
  { id: 34, text: "It's certainly worth a few photographs, but as it's a private home, I'm afraid you can't go inside." },
  { id: 35, text: "Right. Well, if you're all ready, we'll set off on our tour of the farm." }
