  { id: 1, text: "Hello?" },
  { id: 2, text: "Oh, hello." },
  { id: 3, text: "I wanted to enquire about hiring a room in the Village Hall for the evening of September the first." },
  { id: 4, text: "Let me just see..." },
  { id: 5, text: "Yes we have both rooms available that evening." },
  { id: 6, text: "There's our Main Hall - that's got seating for 200 people." },
  { id: 7, text: "Or there's the Charlton Room..." },
  { id: 8, text: "Sorry?" },
  { id: 9, text: "The Charlton Room - C-H-A-R L-T-O-N." },
  { id: 10, text: "That's got seating for up to one hundred." },
  { id: 11, text: "Well we're organising a dinner to raise money for a charity and we're hoping for at least 150 people so I think we'll go for the Main Hall." },
  { id: 12, text: "How much would that cost?" },
  { id: 13, text: "Let's see. You wanted it for the evening of September 1st?" },
  { id: 14, text: "Yes that's a Saturday." },
  { id: 15, text: "So from six pm to midnight that'd be ￡115 - that's the weekend price it's ￡75 on weekdays." },
  { id: 16, text: "That's all right." },
  { id: 17, text: "And I have to tell you there's also a deposit of £250，which is returnable of course as long as there's no damage." },
  { id: 18, text: "But we do insist that this is paid in cash we don't take cards for that." },
  { id: 19, text: "You can pay the actual rent of the room however you like though-- cash, credit card, cheque..." },
  { id: 20, text: "Oh, well I suppose that's OK." },
  { id: 21, text: "So does the charge include use of tables and chairs and so on?" },
  { id: 22, text: "Oh yes." },
  { id: 23, text: "And what about parking?" },
  { id: 24, text: "Yeah. that's all included." },
  { id: 25, text: "The only thing that isn't included is ...you said you were organising a dinner?" },
  { id: 26, text: "Yeah." },
  { id: 27, text: "Well you'll have to pay extra for the kitchen if you want to use that." },
  { id: 28, text: "It's ￡25." },
  { id: 29, text: "It's got very good facilities - good quality cookers and fridges and so on." },
  { id: 30, text: "OK well I suppose that's all right." },
  { id: 31, text: "We can cover the cost in our entry charges." },
  { id: 32, text: "Right. So I'll make a note of that." },
  { id: 33, text: "Now there are just one or two things you need to think about before the event." },
  { id: 34, text: "For example you'll have to see about getting a licence if you're planning to have any music during the meal." },
  { id: 35, text: "Oh really?" },
  { id: 36, text: "It's quite straightforward I'll give you the details later on." },
  { id: 37, text: "And about a week or ten days before your event you'll need to contact the caretaker, that's Mr Evans, to make the arrangements for entry -- he'll sort that out with you." },
  { id: 38, text: "And do I give him the payment as well?" },
  { id: 39, text: "No, you do that directly with me." },
  { id: 40, text: "Right. Now is there anything I need to know about what happens during the event?" },
  { id: 41, text: "Well as you'll be aware of course the building is no smoking throughout." },
  { id: 42, text: "Of course." },
  { id: 43, text: "Now are you having a band?" },
  { id: 44, text: "Yes." },
  { id: 45, text: "Well they'll have a lot of equipment so rather than using the front door they should park their van round the back and use the stage door there." },
  { id: 46, text: "You can open that from inside but don't forget to lock it at the end." },
  { id: 47, text: "OK." },
  { id: 48, text: "And talking of bands, I'm sure I don't need to tell you this but you must make sure that no one fiddles about with the black box by the fire door - that's a system that cuts in when the volume reaches a certain level. It's a legal requirement." },
  { id: 49, text: "Sure. Anyway we want people to be able to talk to one another so we don't want anything too loud." },
  { id: 50, text: "Oh, that reminds me we'll be having speeches - are there any microphones available?" },
  { id: 51, text: "Yeah. Just let the caretaker know he'll get those for you." },
  { id: 52, text: "Right now when the event is over we do ask that the premises are left in good condition." },
  { id: 53, text: "So there's a locked cupboard and you'll be informed of the code you need to open that." },
  { id: 54, text: "It's got all the cleaning equipment brushes and detergent and so on." },
  { id: 55, text: "Right. So what do we need to do after everyone's gone?" },
  { id: 56, text: "Sweep the floors I suppose?" },
  { id: 57, text: "Well, actually they have to be washed not just swept." },
  { id: 58, text: "Then you'll be provided with black plastic bags so all the rubbish must be collected up and left outside the door." },
  { id: 59, text: "Of course. We'll make sure everything's left tidy." },
  { id: 60, text: "Oh and I forgot to ask I presume we can have decorations in the room?" },
  { id: 61, text: "Yes but you must take them down afterwards." },
  { id: 62, text: "Sure." },
  { id: 63, text: "And the chairs and tables should be stacked up neatly at the back of the room." },
  { id: 64, text: "I'll make sure I've got a few people to help me." }
