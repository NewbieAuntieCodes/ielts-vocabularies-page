    <br/><br/>
    No, not really. I have moved to different cities a few times. So, it is hard to keep old friends. I have some good friends now, but I have not known them for very long.`},"What do you usually do with your friends?":{answer:"We do many things. We often go to a coffee shop to talk. Sometimes we go shopping or see a movie."},"Where do you often meet each other?":{answer:"We usually meet at a coffee shop near my home. It is quiet and nice there. Sometimes we meet at a shopping mall. We can eat and shop there. It is easy. Where we meet depends on our plan."},"How often do you go out with your friends?":{answer:"I try to meet my friends every week, like on a weekend. But sometimes we are all busy with work or school. So, we meet maybe two or three times a month. We talk on the phone if we cannot meet."},"How important are friends to you?":{answer:"Friends are very important to me. They are like my family. If I have a problem, I can talk to them. They give me good ideas. When I am happy, I tell them about it. Without friends, life is not interesting."},"Do you prefer to spend time with one friend or with a group of friends?":{answer:"I like both. It depends. If I want to talk about something serious, I like to meet just one friend. But for fun, like a party, I like a big group. It is more fun with more people."},"Would you invite friends to your home?":{answer:`Yes. I like to ask my good friends to come to my home. We can cook, watch TV, and relax. It is more comfortable at home. It is also private. My parents also like my friends.
    <br/><br/>
    No, not usually. My home is quite small and far from the city center. It is not very convenient for my friends to come over. We usually prefer to meet somewhere outside, like a cafe.`},"Is there a difference between where you meet friends now and where you used to meet them in the past?":{answer:`Yes, it is very different. In the past, when I was a student, we met at school or in a park. We had no money. Now, I have a job, so I have money. We often meet in a restaurant or a coffee shop.
    <br/><br/>
    No, not much difference. When I was young, I met my friends in parks or cafes. Now, we still meet in similar places. We like places where we can sit and talk for a long time.`},"Why are some places suitable for meeting while others are not?":{answer:"Some places are good for meeting friends. For example, a coffee shop is good because it is quiet and we can talk. A library is not good because you must be quiet. A crowded place is also not good, like a train station. It is hard to talk there."}},a={"Do you have a friend you have known for a long time?":{answer:`Absolutely. My best friend is someone I've known since middle school, so we've been friends for over a decade now. Her name is Li Mei. We've gone through a lot together.

    Not really. Because my family moved a couple of times, it's been difficult to maintain long-term friendships. I have some great friends at the moment, but our relationships are relatively new.`},"What do you usually do with your friends?":{answer:"Well, it varies. Most of the time, we enjoy just hanging out at a cozy coffee shop and chatting for hours. If we're looking for something more active, we might go shopping downtown or catch the latest movie."},"Where do you often meet each other?":{answer:"We usually meet at a convenient place for both of us, like a coffee shop downtown. It's a nice, quiet place to talk. Sometimes, if the weather is good, we'll go to a park."},"How often do you go out with your friends?":{answer:"I try to see my friends at least once a week, usually on the weekend. We are all quite busy with our jobs, so it can be difficult to find time. We use social media to stay in touch."},"How important are friends to you?":{answer:"Friends are extremely important to me. They provide emotional support, and I can share my happiness and sadness with them. Life would be very boring without them."},"Do you prefer to spend time with one friend or with a group of friends?":{answer:"It depends on the situation. For a deep conversation, I prefer to meet with just one friend. But for celebrating something or just having fun, I enjoy being with a big group of friends."},"Would you invite friends to your home?":{answer:"Yes, definitely. I enjoy having my close friends over to my apartment. We can cook dinner together or watch a movie. It's much more relaxed than going out."},"Is there a difference between where you meet friends now and where you used to meet them in the past?":{answer:"Yes, there is a big difference. When we were students, we often met on campus or at a cheap restaurant. Now that we have jobs, we prefer to go to nicer places like cafes or trendy restaurants."},"Why are some places suitable for meeting while others are not?":{answer:"Well, a good place for meeting friends should be quiet enough to have a conversation, like a cafe. A library or a noisy bar would not be suitable because it's hard to talk. It also depends on the activity we plan to do."}},r={"Do you have a friend you have known for a long time?":{answer:`Yes, of course. I have a really good friend named Li Mei, and we've known each other since we were in middle school. That means we've been friends for more than 10 years. We've shared a lot of memories together and have always been there for each other.
    <br/><br/>
    To be honest, not really. My family relocated several times when I was younger, which made it challenging to keep in touch with old friends. I've made some wonderful friends where I live now, but I haven't known them for a very long time.`},"What do you usually do with your friends?":{answer:"It depends on our mood, really. We often just meet up at a café to chat and catch up on things. Other times, if we feel more energetic, we might decide to go shopping together or see a new film that's just been released."},"Where do you often meet each other?":{answer:"Our usual meeting spot is a café located halfway between my home and my friend's place, which is convenient for both of us. We like it because it has a relaxed atmosphere. Occasionally, we'll arrange to meet at a park if the weather is pleasant."},"How often do you go out with your friends?":{answer:"I make an effort to hang out with my friends on a weekly basis, typically on Saturdays. Since we all have demanding schedules with work, coordinating can be a challenge. We rely heavily on messaging apps to communicate during the week."},"How important are friends to you?":{answer:"My friends are vital to my well-being. They're my support system, the people I turn to for advice. Sharing experiences with them, both good and bad, makes life much more meaningful. I honestly can't imagine my life without their companionship."},"Do you prefer to spend time with one friend or with a group of friends?":{answer:"I enjoy both, but for different reasons. I prefer one-on-one meetings for more personal and serious conversations. However, for social events like birthdays or holidays, being in a larger group is definitely more festive and enjoyable."},"Would you invite friends to your home?":{answer:"Of course. I love hosting my friends at my place. It offers a more comfortable and private setting where we can just relax, maybe cook a meal together, and not worry about the time. It feels more personal than meeting in a public place."},"Is there a difference between where you meet friends now and where you used to meet them in the past?":{answer:"There's a significant difference. Back in our student days, our options were limited by budget, so we would usually meet on campus or at inexpensive food courts. Nowadays, since we're financially independent, we tend to choose more comfortable venues, like stylish cafes or nice restaurants."},"Why are some places suitable for meeting while others are not?":{answer:"The suitability of a place really depends on the purpose of the meeting. For catching up, a place like a café is ideal because it allows for easy conversation. On the other hand, a place like a library is unsuitable due to the need for silence, and a crowded nightclub would be a poor choice for a heart-to-heart talk because of the noise level."}},n={"Do you have a friend you have known for a long time?":{answer:`Definitely. I'm lucky enough to have a very close friend, Li Mei, whom I've known for what feels like a lifetime—over ten years, in fact. We first met back in middle school and we've been inseparable ever since. It's quite special to have a friendship that has lasted that long.
    <br/><br/>
    Unfortunately, I don't. Due to moving cities several times throughout my life, I haven't been able to maintain those kinds of long-lasting friendships. While I cherish the friends I have now, I do sometimes wish I had a friend who has known me since I was a child.`},"What do you usually do with your friends?":{answer:"Our activities are quite diverse, actually. A typical get-together might involve grabbing a coffee at our favorite local spot to catch up on each other's lives. However, we also enjoy more recreational activities, like going shopping for the latest trends or catching a blockbuster movie at the cinema. It really just depends on our mood."},"Where do you often meet each other?":{answer:"We're quite flexible, but our go-to spot is a quaint little coffee shop in the city center. It's got a great ambiance for conversation. Alternatively, if we're in the mood for some fresh air, we'll opt for a stroll in a nearby park, which is a wonderful change of scenery."},"How often do you go out with your friends?":{answer:"I'd say we manage to get together pretty regularly, at least once a week, usually over the weekend. Juggling our work commitments can be tricky, but we make it a priority to catch up in person. In between, we're constantly in touch via our group chat."},"How important are friends to you?":{answer:"Friends are absolutely indispensable to me. They offer a unique kind of support and perspective that you can't always get from family. They're the ones I celebrate my successes with and lean on during difficult times. Life would be significantly less rich and enjoyable without them."},"Do you prefer to spend time with one friend or with a group of friends?":{answer:"It really depends on the context. For an intimate chat where I can really open up, I much prefer the company of a single close friend. However, when it comes to social gatherings or celebrating an occasion, being part of a lively group dynamic is far more exhilarating."},"Would you invite friends to your home?":{answer:"Yes, all the time. I'm a firm believer that hosting friends at home creates a warmer and more intimate atmosphere. We can be ourselves, play some music, maybe even experiment with a new recipe, all without the distractions or time constraints of a public venue."},"Is there a difference between where you meet friends now and where you used to meet them in the past?":{answer:"Yes, definitely. When we were younger and on a tight budget, our hangouts were simple – school libraries, parks, or fast-food joints. Now that we're professionals with disposable income, our tastes have evolved. We tend to gravitate towards more sophisticated settings like artisanal coffee shops or highly-rated restaurants."},"Why are some places suitable for meeting while others are not?":{answer:"A place's suitability is determined by the intended social interaction. An ideal spot facilitates the kind of engagement you're looking for. For instance, cafes are perfect for conversation, whereas cinemas are great for a shared experience but not for talking. Places like libraries are inherently unsuitable for socializing due to strict noise rules, making them counterproductive for a friendly catch-up."}},F=["Do you have a friend you have known for a long time?","What do you usually do with your friends?","Where do you often meet each other?","How often do you go out with your friends?","How important are friends to you?","Do you prefer to spend time with one friend or with a group of friends?","Would you invite friends to your home?","Is there a difference between where you meet friends now and where you used to meet them in the past?","Why are some places suitable for meeting while others are not?"],B=F.map(e=>{const o=[];return t[e]&&o.push({score:"5.0",...t[e]}),a[e]&&o.push({score:"5.5",...a[e]}),r[e]&&o.push({score:"6.0",...r[e]}),n[e]&&o.push({score:"6.5",...n[e]}),{question:e,versions:o}}).filter(e=>e.versions.length>0),$={id:"box-part1-topic-a",title:"话题: 人物与社交",cards:[{id:"p1-c1",title:"Friends",category:"人物题",categoryClass:"person-card",status:"New",part1Questions:["Do you have a friend you have known for a long time?","What do you usually do with your friends?","Where do you often meet each other?","How often do you go out with your friends?","How important are friends to you?","Do you prefer to spend time with one friend or with a group of friends?","Would you invite friends to your home?","Is there a difference between where you meet friends now and where you used to meet them in the past?","Why are some places suitable for meeting while others are not?"],sampleAnswers:B},{id:"p1-c11",title:"Staying with old people",category:"事件题",categoryClass:"event-card",status:"New",part1Questions:["Have you ever worked with old people?","Are you happy to work with people who are older than you?","What are the benefits of being friends with or working with old people?","Do you enjoy spending time with old people?"],sampleAnswers:[{question:"Have you ever worked with old people?",versions:[{score:"5.0",answer:`Yes, I have.

                No, I haven't had a formal job working with older adults because I'm still a student.

I had a part-time job at a nursing home for a few months. My responsibilities included helping to organize recreational activities like board games and reading sessions. It was quite an eye-opening experience, and I learned a lot about the challenges and wisdom of the elderly.
                <br/><br/>
                Professionally, no, as my studies haven't led me in that direction. But on a personal level, I frequently collaborate with my grandparents on household projects. For example, we recently built a small garden together. I find I learn a great deal from their practical skills and life experience.`},{score:"6.5",answer:`Absolutely. I had a wonderful opportunity last summer to intern at an organization that provides support for the elderly. I was involved in coordinating social events and providing companionship. It was an incredibly humbling experience that gave me a profound appreciation for the older generation.

                While I haven't been formally employed in a capacity that involves working with seniors, I've had extensive informal experience.

                I have never thought about it. I think it depends on the person, not their age. If they are nice and easy to work with, I would be happy. Their age is not important to me.`},{score:"5.5",answer:`Yes, I would be quite happy to. I think older people have a wealth of experience, so I could learn a lot from them. They are generally very patient and can be great mentors for younger colleagues.
                <br/><br/>
                I haven't really considered it before. I believe it's more about the individual's personality than their age. If they are kind, cooperative, and respectful, I would definitely enjoy working with them. Age isn't a factor for me.`},{score:"6.0",answer:`Yes, I think it would be a very positive experience.

I believe their experience could be a valuable asset to any team, and I would be eager to learn from their insights.
                <br/><br/>
                I'm open to it. For me, a good working relationship depends on mutual respect and effective communication, not on age. As long as we can collaborate well and contribute to the team's goals, I don't see why age would be an issue.`},{score:"6.5",answer:`Without a doubt. I would actually relish the opportunity.

                Honestly, age is irrelevant to me in a professional setting. What matters is a person's attitude, work ethic, and expertise.

                <br/><br/>

                <br/><br/>
                I doubt it. While popular places are crowded for a reason, I think people tolerate the crowds to enjoy the activity, rather than enjoying the crowd itself.

                I would argue that most people don't actively like the crowd itself, but they are drawn to what the crowded place offers, whether it's a popular restaurant, a concert, or a major shopping center.

I only purchase new shoes when my current pair is worn out, which is usually about once a year.`},"Have you ever bought shoes online?":{answer:`Yes, I have. Online shopping is very convenient and offers a much wider selection. I'm confident about my size, so it's usually a smooth process.
    <br/><br/>
    No, I haven't. I'm very particular about the fit of my shoes, so I need to try them on first. I don't want to go through the hassle of returning them if they don't fit well.`},"How much money do you usually spend on shoes?":{answer:"It varies, but I typically spend between 300 and 500 RMB on a good pair of sneakers. I look for a balance of quality and price; I don't need designer brands."},"Which do you prefer, fashionable shoes or comfortable shoes?":{answer:`I prioritize comfort over fashion. Since I'm on my feet for most of the day, having comfortable shoes is essential for me. A stylish design is a bonus, but not a necessity.
    <br/><br/>
    I would say I lean towards fashionable shoes. I see shoes as a key accessory that can elevate an outfit. I'm willing to sacrifice a bit of comfort for a great look.`}},j={"Do you like buying shoes? How often?":{answer:`Yes, I'm a bit of a shoe enthusiast. I enjoy keeping up with the latest trends. I'd say I buy new shoes on a seasonal basis, so about four times a year.
    <br/><br/>
    No, I'm very practical when it comes to shoes. I only replace them out of necessity, not for fashion. So, I buy new shoes very infrequently, only when my old ones can no longer be worn.`},"Have you ever bought shoes online?":{answer:`Yes, frequently. I find the online selection to be far superior to what's available in local stores. I always read the reviews carefully to check the sizing, and I've had good luck with it.
    <br/><br/>
    No, I'm a firm believer in trying before buying. The comfort and fit are paramount, and you can't assess that from a picture online. I prefer the traditional in-store shopping experience for footwear.`},"How much money do you usually spend on shoes?":{answer:"My budget for a pair of everyday shoes is usually around 500 RMB. I believe in investing in good quality footwear because it lasts longer and is better for your feet."},"Which do you prefer, fashionable shoes or comfortable shoes?":{answer:`I always opt for comfort. In my opinion, if your shoes aren't comfortable, it can ruin your whole day. Luckily, many brands now offer styles that are both comfortable and fashionable, so I don't have to compromise.
    <br/><br/>
    I admit I'm often swayed by fashion. I see shoes as a statement piece, and I enjoy expressing my personality through my footwear. For special occasions, I'll definitely choose style over comfort.`}},A={"Do you like buying shoes? How often?":{answer:`Yes, I definitely have a passion for footwear. I appreciate the craftsmanship and design that goes into a good pair of shoes. I don't buy them impulsively, but I might invest in a new pair every season to keep my collection updated.
    <br/><br/>
    Not at all. I have a very minimalist approach to shoes. I own a few versatile pairs, and I only buy new ones when the old ones are beyond repair. I see them as a utility, not a fashion item.`},"Have you ever bought shoes online?":{answer:`Yes, almost exclusively. The convenience of having shoes delivered to my door, combined with the vast variety available online, is unbeatable. I'm familiar with the brands I like, so sizing is rarely an issue.
    <br/><br/>
    No, and I don't plan to. For me, buying shoes is a tactile experience. I need to feel the material, see how they look on my feet, and walk around in them. That's something the online experience simply can't replicate.`},"How much money do you usually spend on shoes?":{answer:"I'm willing to invest a reasonable amount in a quality pair of shoes, perhaps up to 800 RMB. My philosophy is that well-made shoes are a long-term investment in both style and comfort."},"Which do you prefer, fashionable shoes or comfortable shoes?":{answer:`Comfort is non-negotiable for me. I believe that true style comes from confidence, and I can't feel confident if my feet are in pain. My priority is always to find shoes that provide good support, and if they happen to be stylish, that's an added bonus.
    <br/><br/>
    I'm drawn to fashionable footwear. I view shoes as an art form and a way to make a bold statement. While I wouldn't wear something that causes me extreme pain, I'm certainly willing to tolerate a degree of discomfort for the sake of a cutting-edge design.`}},J=["Do you like buying shoes?

My teacher gave it to me. I put it in a small pot. I was very happy when I saw it grow."},"Do you know anything about growing a plant?":{answer:`Yes, a little. I know plants need water and sun.

    No, not much. I just know they need water. I don't know about soil or other things.`},"Do Chinese people send plants as gifts?":{answer:`Yes, sometimes. For a new home or a new shop, people give a big plant. It means good luck.

I remember putting a bean in a cup with wet cotton.

Plants need sunlight, water, and good soil to grow. I also know that you shouldn't water them too much. I learned these things from online articles.
    <br/><br/>
    Honestly, I know very little. Apart from the fact that they need sunlight and water, I'm quite clueless about gardening. I wouldn't know what kind of soil or fertilizer to use.`},"Do Chinese people send plants as gifts?":{answer:`Yes, it's quite common for certain occasions. For example, when someone opens a new business or moves into a new home, it's popular to send a large potted plant as a gift to wish them success and prosperity.
    <br/><br/>
    It happens, but it's not as popular as other gifts like fruits or fine tea. I think it's because taking care of a plant requires some effort, and not everyone might appreciate that responsibility.`}},H={"Do you keep plants at home?":{answer:`Yes, I do. I have a small collection of houseplants, like a snake plant and a spider plant. I find that they really liven up my apartment and improve the atmosphere. It's also a relaxing hobby for me.

    No, unfortunately.

We planted the seed in his garden, and he taught me how to water it and make sure it got enough sun. I was amazed at how tall it grew."},"Do you know anything about growing a plant?":{answer:`I have some practical knowledge. I understand the importance of proper drainage in pots and the need to choose plants that suit the light conditions in my home. I've learned most of what I know from watching gardening videos online.
    <br/><br/>
    I'm a complete novice, to be honest. I'm aware of the fundamental requirements like water and light, but beyond that, my knowledge is very limited. I wouldn't know how to deal with pests or choose the right soil.`},"Do Chinese people send plants as gifts?":{answer:`Yes, definitely. Potted plants, especially orchids or lucky bamboo, are very popular gifts for occasions like a housewarming or the Spring Festival. They symbolize growth, life, and good fortune, which makes them a very meaningful present.
    <br/><br/>
    It's not the most conventional gift, I would say. While some people appreciate receiving plants, most people would probably prefer something more practical or edible. It really depends on the recipient's personal taste and lifestyle.`}},S={"Do you keep plants at home?":{answer:`Absolutely. My apartment is filled with greenery. I find that having plants around creates a more tranquil and healthy living environment. Tending to them is a form of meditation for me; it's a very grounding activity.
    <br/><br/>
    No, I don't. While I appreciate the beauty of plants, I know that I lack the commitment required to keep them alive. I'd rather admire them in a park or a botanical garden than be responsible for their well-being at home.`},"What plant did you grow when you were young?":{answer:"I distinctly remember my first gardening project was growing cherry tomatoes on my family's balcony. My father taught me how to care for them.

I'm familiar with concepts like different soil types, the importance of nutrients, and how to prune plants to encourage growth. It's a fascinating subject, and I'm always learning something new from books and online forums.

    I'm afraid my knowledge is extremely basic. I can keep a hardy plant alive by watering it occasionally, but that's the extent of my abilities. The science behind horticulture is something I have yet to explore.`},"Do Chinese people send plants as gifts?":{answer:`Yes, it's a very common practice, deeply rooted in cultural symbolism. For instance, giving a money tree is a way of wishing someone financial prosperity, while an orchid represents elegance and friendship. So, a plant is often more than just a decorative item; it carries a specific blessing.
    <br/><br/>
    While it's not an everyday gift, it's certainly a popular choice for specific events. I think it's becoming more fashionable, especially among younger people who are more environmentally conscious and appreciate a gift that is sustainable and long-lasting.`}},X=["Do you keep plants at home?","What plant did you grow when you were young?","Do you know anything about growing a plant?","Do Chinese people send plants as gifts?"],Z=X.map(e=>{const o=[];return N[e]&&o.push({score:"5.0",...N[e]}),q[e]&&o.push({score:"5.5",...q[e]}),H[e]&&o.push({score:"6.0",...H[e]}),S[e]&&o.push({score:"6.5",...S[e]}),{question:e,versions:o}}).filter(e=>e.versions.length>0),ee={id:"box-part1-topic-d",title:"话题: 事物",cards:[{id:"p1-c5",title:"Advertisement",category:"事物题",categoryClass:"object-card",status:"New",part1Questions:["Is there an advertisement that made an impression on you when you were a child?","Do you see a lot of advertising on trains or other transport?","Do you like advertisements?","What kind of advertising do you like?","Do you often see advertisements when you are on your phone or computer?"],sampleAnswers:G},{id:"p1-c14",title:"Rules",category:"事物题",categoryClass:"object-card",status:"New",part1Questions:["Are there any rules for students at your school?","Do you think students would benefit more from more rules?","Have you ever had a really dedicated teacher?","Do you prefer to have more or fewer rules at school?","Have you ever had a really strict teacher?","Would you like to work as a teacher in a rule-free school?"],sampleAnswers:U},{id:"p1-c13",title:"Shoes",category:"事物题",categoryClass:"object-card",status:"New",part1Questions:["Do you like buying shoes?
