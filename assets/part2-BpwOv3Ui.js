(Point) Most people have a natural tendency to stick to what they know because it's predictable and feels safe, whereas new experiences come with inherent risks and uncertainties.

This was a hugely important moment that I had been working towards for a long time.<br/><br/>I remember that day vividly. I waited at home, mostly in my own room. I had my laptop set up on my desk, with the university's admissions portal open in a browser tab. I tried to act calm, but I was too restless to focus on anything else. I think I must have checked the website a hundred times that afternoon, hoping to see an update.<br/><br/>The reason this was so special was that it felt like a turning point in my life. Being accepted into that specific program was not just about getting a degree; it was about pursuing my passion and setting the foundation for my future career. I had poured countless hours into studying and preparing my application. Everything felt like it was leading up to this single moment.<br/><br/>While waiting, I experienced a real rollercoaster of emotions. I was incredibly anxious and my mind was racing. I kept imagining different scenarios – the joy of being accepted and the disappointment of being rejected. My hands were literally shaking as I refreshed the page for the final time. When I saw the acceptance letter on the screen, I was completely overwhelmed with happiness.

It was the day the admission results for my top-choice university were released. This was a pivotal moment for me, as I had spent the better part of my high school years working towards getting into their computer science program.<br/><br/>On the day the results were due, I confined myself to my room at home. I was glued to my chair, with my laptop open to the university's admissions portal. The hours seemed to drag on endlessly. I tried to distract myself with a movie, but I couldn't concentrate at all. My parents were great; they knew I needed some space and just quietly left snacks by my door.<br/><br/>This wait was so special because it represented the culmination of years of dedication. It wasn't just about getting into a good school; it was about validating all the sacrifices I had made and proving to myself that I could achieve my goals. My whole academic and future career path seemed to hang in the balance, which made the anticipation almost unbearable.<br/><br/>My feelings during that wait were a chaotic mix of anxiety and excitement. I felt like I was on pins and needles the entire day. Every notification sound from my phone made my heart jump. As the designated time approached, my palms were sweating.

It's a very common part of life."}]},{question:"Who behave better when waiting, children or adults?",versions:[{score:"5.5",answer:"Generally, I think adults behave better when waiting. They have more self-control and understand that waiting is often necessary. Children, on the other hand, can get bored and restless very easily, so they might start to complain or cry."}]},{question:"Compared to the past, are people less patient now? Why?",versions:[{score:"5.5",answer:"Yes, I believe people are generally less patient now. This is probably because of modern technology.

Some people have very busy lives and feel that any time spent waiting is wasted time. For others, it might just be their personality; they are naturally impatient.
